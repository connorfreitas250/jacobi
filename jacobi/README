Jacobi Project for CS322

jacobi takes up to 5 command line arguments as follows:

	 ./jacobi N M inputfile [number of threads] [print output option]

N: int - height of matrix
M: int - width of matrix
inputfile: char* - starting NxM matrix for Jacobi iteration
number of threads: int - taken to be an integer between 1 and N-2
print output option: char* - if "y", jacobi will print the newly calculated matrix to stdout; if not, jacobi will return silently

Example: ./jacobi 2048 2048 input.mtx 8 y

The above command will print the results of an 8-threaded run of jacobi, given a 2048x2048 matrix called "input.mtx".
